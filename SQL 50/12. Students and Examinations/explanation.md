1. **SELECT Clause:**
   ```sql
   SELECT
       s.student_id,
       s.student_name,
       sub.subject_name,
       COUNT(e.subject_name) AS attended_exams
   ```
   - This part of the query selects the columns that will be included in the final result.
   - `s.student_id` and `s.student_name` are columns from the `Students` table.
   - `sub.subject_name` is the subject name from the `Subjects` table.
   - `COUNT(e.subject_name)` calculates the number of attended exams for each student and subject. The `AS attended_exams` assigns a label to this count, making it easier to reference in the result set.

2. **FROM Clause:**
   ```sql
   FROM Students s
   CROSS JOIN Subjects sub
   LEFT JOIN Examinations e ON s.student_id = e.student_id AND sub.subject_name = e.subject_name
   ```
   - The `FROM` clause specifies the tables involved in the query.
   - `Students s` and `Subjects sub` are aliases for the `Students` and `Subjects` tables, respectively.
   - `CROSS JOIN` combines each row from the `Students` table with each row from the `Subjects` table, creating all possible combinations of students and subjects.
   - `LEFT JOIN Examinations e` links the result of the cross join with the `Examinations` table based on matching student_id and subject_name. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that all rows from the left tables (`Students` and `Subjects`) are included in the result, even if there is no match in the `Examinations` table.

3. **GROUP BY Clause:**
   ```sql
   GROUP BY
       s.student_id,
       s.student_name,
       sub.subject_name
   ```
   - The `GROUP BY` clause groups the result set by the specified columns.
   - In this case, it groups by `student_id`, `student_name`, and `subject_name` to aggregate the counts for each unique combination of student and subject.

4. **ORDER BY Clause:**
   ```sql
   ORDER BY
       s.student_id,
       sub.subject_name;
   ```
   - The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the final result set in ascending order based on `student_id` and `subject_name`.

Putting it all together, the query creates a result set that includes all students, all subjects, and the count of exams attended by each student for each subject. The output is ordered by student_id and subject_name. The `LEFT JOIN` ensures that students who did not attend exams for certain subjects will still appear in the result with a count of 0 for those subjects.
